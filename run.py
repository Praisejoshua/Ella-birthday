I must have done something wild to have met you and kept you in my life, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way.  

Iâ€™ll keep this shortâ€”Happy Birthday! ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for everything, for always being there, for the jokes, for the gist, for DLS, for just being "you". I appreciate you more than words can say, and I love you so much.  

Distance may be a thing now, but if I could, Iâ€™d trade anything to be by your side today. Happy Birthday, Ella! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ¤—.
